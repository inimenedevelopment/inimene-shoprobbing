**Inimene-shoprobbing**

Inimene-shoprobbing is a configurable script for FiveM servers that adds a shoplifting feature with support for different targeting systems (ox_target and qb-target). Players can attempt to steal items from specified locations, with configurable loot items, cooldowns, and the chance to alert the police.
